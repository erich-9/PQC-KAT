# KAT for FIPS-203 and FIPS-204

* FIPS-203 generated by closed-source implementation
* FIPS-204 generated by [Dilithium](https://github.com/pq-crystals/dilithium/tree/standard) software package.

## Differences with the spec

### Kyber
- Index ``i`` and ``j`` are swaped when doing matrix A expansion. Namely code expands the matrix in following way ``A[i][j] = Parse(XOF(rho,j,i)`` instead of ``A[i][j] = Parse(XOF(rho,i,j)``.
- Additionaly values of ``z`` (alg 15), ``d`` (alg 12) and ``msg`` (value ``m`` from alg 16) are provided.
- no tests for key validation, negative tests are also not available


### Dilithium
- "deterministic" variant was used to generate KATs
- Byte oriented implementation
